Question 3:

A) Unsigned Binary Representation:

In an unsigned binary number, all bits represent the magnitude of the value, 
meaning there is no sign bit. The value is determined by 
treating the entire binary sequence as a standard base-2 number.

So, To convert this binary number to decimal, we expand 
it using positional notation:

(0 x 2^31) + (0 x 2^30)..... (1 x 2^24)... all the way to the end. 

B) Twos Complement representation:

in twos complement the left most bit is reffered to as the most significant bit, or sign bit.

Where:

0 -> indicates positive number
1 -> negative number, and we subtract 2^n where n is the num of bits to get 
the correct decimal value.


C) BCD:

we start by converting each 4 bit chicl tp decimal then put it all together.

0101 = 5
1001 = 9
0110 = 6
0101 = 5
0111 = 7
0010 = 2
0001 = 1

read them top down and get: 5965721

D) Biased-231 Representation

adding the bias number 2^31 = 2147483648 

we do actual decimal value - binary value - Biased

so,
    1498377761−2147483648=−649105887


E) will do in python
