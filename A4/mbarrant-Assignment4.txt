Key takeaways when comparing 1 & 3

- Embeddings excel at capturing semantic meaning, 
making them superior for tasks requiring understanding of paraphrases or synonyms.

- One-Hot Encoding is faster but limited to surface-level word overlap.

- Trade-offs: 
    - Choose embeddings for accuracy in semantic tasks.
    - Use one-hot for simple, fast lexical analysis.
